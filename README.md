This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


# Project Description 👩🏽‍🔬

This is a basic app using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Taliwind css, Daisy UI and React-three-fiber for some 3D elements. 
I wanted to just test a simple way to use the different frameworks and liberaries. I have not tried Daisy or React-three-fiber before so that was new to me. 
The app is just an iphone placeholder with some moving 3D boxes inside, and some stars where you can rate (Im not storing any rating, so go on and rate).
The two buttons you can click will show you the HTML syntax for the elements used and links to docs, so you can try it yourself/or contribute to this project.
Btw, did you know you can add video content to your md file... Well me neither.. Lets try it for the sake of a sneak peak:

## Getting Started 🕵️
### (More eloborated steps are coming-stay put or email me if you have any questions)

For now, you can just clone the project, 
and run the app in your local enviorment with 
```bash
npm run dev
```
```bash
yarn run dev
```
```bash
bun run dev
```
or whatever you use to 🏃‍♀ stuff

## Contributions 👨‍🚒
Feel free to create a branch and send a pull request. I would love to find out a better solution for styling the text inside the pop-ups (my current solution is a little jacky but works fine). Perhaps a better read up on the Daisy docs would be good...Anyways- would love to develop this further. The coolest thing would be to have all kinds of Daisy and 3D(three-fiber) elements over the page, and with a hover, you can see the code snipplets. Its a littly tricky to make this nice (yes, I tried), but I'm sure youll come up with something brainy for this one. Fingers crossed. And if you need me..
